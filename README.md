Designing-a-optimal-traffic-controller-choosing-between-distributed-and-centralized-controllers.
Matlab simulation for choosing the right combination of distributed and centralized controllers.
The LSS Final Project pdf file contains the problem statement(unfurtunately in Persian).
Though, the final project report pdf contains a thorough report on the code and the final conclution.
Hope it helps you.
